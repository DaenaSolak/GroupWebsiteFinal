			<h3 class="vistitle">Navigation Structure</h3>
					<p class="vision">At the start of PRJ4 – Brand Development, we as the team behind DAUNT. wanted to create a page that was easy to access, since our target group lies between 13 to 21 year olds. So, the pages had to be easy to navigate for both a young and somewhat older audience. When you first enter the DAUNT. website you ‘’land’’ on our homepage. From there on out you can utilize the navigation bar to browse through our website. Instead of being overly creative with the nav-items (for instance, there was an initial idea to call the ‘’contact page’’ the ‘’join the movement page’’), we opted to just be straightforward. Want to know what DAUNT. is? You click on ‘’about’’. Want to buy tickets to a DAUNT. event? You click on ‘’Events/Tickets’’. Want to come in contact with DAUNT.? You click on ‘’contact’’. </p>
			<h3 class="vistitle">Wireframes</h3>
					<p class="vision">When you visit the home/landing page, we wanted viewers to directly understand the meaning of DAUNT. In the carousel next to this paragraph, you can see the wireframes we created before the commencement of the actual coding of the website. On our home/landing page, are testimonials by members of the DAUNT. ‘’army’’. These testimonials include quotes given by the women in the accompanying photos as to why DAUNT. helped them or what it means to them to be DAUNT. From there you can go anywhere in the site using the navigation bar. If you want to find out who the team is behind DAUNT., what the story is and the overall meaning, you can click on ‘’about’’. As mentioned earlier, tickets can be bought when clicking on the events/tickets page (you first go to a page that has info on the events and then when clicking on buy tickets you go to a second page where you can choose between two different ticket packages (regular and vip). Finally, the contact page was a must since DAUNT. wants to keep growing their army. There is a link to the brand’s Instagram page, twitter page, and email.</p>
			  		<p class="vision">Throughout the course of the project, we did make changes to the layout and structure of the website. Some things were removed, some things were added. The changes made were the following:</p>
					<p class="vision">Home/landing page – A banner was added at the top of the page with a button indicating that people could now buy tickets to the next DAUNT. event.</p>
					<p class="vision">About page – The first idea was to have two pages. One with an overview of the sections that were a part of the ‘’about’’ page and you could click on a button under each section to go to a new page. However, this idea was discarded in favour of one page with all the about info.</p>
					<p class="vision">The why of these changes will be explained further in the user testing report portion of this page.</p>
			  <h3 class="vistitle">Font and Colour</h3>
					<p class="vision">As for the colour and font choices, DAUNT. is a brand that was designed for young girls and young adult women. The DAUNT. Brand Road Map had lots of pink tones dominating the pages. To avoid turning the whole website into an uncontrollable, ''child-like'', pink mess, we opted to add that little touch of ''girly-ness'' to the headings of texts. We wanted the navbar to be pink and striking, so naturally the font colour of the text is NOT pink (it would disappear in the background or if we used another shade of pink it would look like Sami from middle school made a website in wordpress and decided to do ''PINK PINK PINK''. We used the html colour 'pink' (#FFC0CB). The website is meant to convey youthfulness andf freshness, and the 'Constantia, "Lucida Bright", "DejaVu Serif", Georgia, "serif"' font fit the look of the website. It is not thick and in your face like the font of the headers, it is subtle and light. </p>

			<h3 class="vistitle">User Testing Report</h3>
					<p class="vision">For the User Testing Report we initially used the method ‘paper prototyping’. Daena first drew out
					the paper prototyping. After finishing the drawings of the paper prototyping, Melissa made it digital.
					Here you can view our digital prototyping: https://xd.adobe.com/view/fa5df754-010c-4e2c-7618-
					7904ea1fad2a-8c6c/. We decided to have 1 test user each, so 4 test users in total. The tasks we gave
						our test users were:</p>
			  <p class="vision">1. Send DAUNT. an e-mail.</p>
			  <p class="vision">2. Buy a ticket for the DAUNT. event.</p>
			  <p class="vision">3. Go to the DAUNT. Instagram page.</p>
			  <p class="vision">4. Find out who the team is behind DAUNT.</p>
			  <p class="vision">5. Find out what the story is behind DAUNT.</p>
			<h3 class="vistitle">Outcomes</h3>
			  		<p class="vision">The outcomes of the user testing was:</p>
			  <p class="vision">1. Send DAUNT. an e-mail.</p>
			  <p class="vision">Assignments achieved with no problems. 4/4</p>
			  <p class="vision">2. Buy a ticket for the DAUNT. event</p>
			  <p class="vision">Assignments achieved with slight “problem” of the “Buy” button. 2/4</p>
			  <p class="vision">Assignments achieved with no problems. 2/4</p>
			  <p class="vision">3. Go to the DAUNT. Instagram page.</p>
			  <p class="vision">Assignments achieved with no problems. 4/4</p>
			  <p class="vision">4. Find out who the team is behind DAUNT.</p>
			  <p class="vision">Assignment achieved with slight “problem” as to clicking on the right section on the about page. 1/4</p>
			  <p class="vision">Assignments achieved with no problems. 3/4</p>
			  <p class="vision">5. Find out what the story is behind DAUNT.</p>
			 <p class="vision">Assignments achieved with no problems. 4/4</p>
			  <h3 class="vistitle">Recap Issues</h3>
			  		<p class="vision">Two usability issues were found. For the “Buy a ticket for the DAUNT. event”, 2 test users ran into the problem of confusion. The confusion occurred when the test users saw two buttons which said “buy”, they didn’t know which of the two to push. However, during designing the website it will be clear that the separate cards are for two separate days of the event as we changed the button texts to “Get basic entrance” and “Get premium entrance”. For the “find out who the team is behind DAUNT.”, 1 test user ran into the problem of confusion. The test user clicked on the section that was about “Who is DAUNT.”, instead of the “Team behind DAUNT.” section. This due to the team photo not having a title. So, the assignment was achieved with slight “problem” as to clicking on the right section on the about page due to lack of title. This is fixed by only having one page called “About” which includes “Origin”, ”What is DAUNT.”, “Our Goal” and “Team behind DAUNT. ”.</p>
